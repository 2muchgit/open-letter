Stop using ChatGPT to write your stuff.
Stop Politicizing an IT project.
Code is what matters not people, do not like the code make your own, do not like the people do not engage.
Make a survey do show real numbers about insatisfaction.

Imagine starting an open source project only to find out people are trying to take over because of:
 - OMG PR takes to long
 - OMG they do not expand the team, to allow XZ backdoor type events
 - OMG they are in bed with the military.
 - OMG bunch of right wingers.
 
 Hahahaha ridiculous, have fun Forking NixOS/Community
